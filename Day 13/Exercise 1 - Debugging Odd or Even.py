#Code with error to fix:
# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

# if number % 2 = 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")
  

#Corrected code
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
